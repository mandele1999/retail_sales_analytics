# Retail Sales Data Engineering Project 
## Project Overview
This project is focused on developing a comprehensive data engineering workflow for a retail sales dataset, from data ingestion to analysis and visualization. We use a structured ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to clean, transform, and aggregate the data to uncover insights into customer purchasing behavior, product popularity, and overall sales trends.

## Objectives
1. * Data Exploration and Cleaning *: Load the dataset, inspect and clean it by handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data integrity.
2. Data Transformation: Apply feature engineering techniques to enhance the dataset with additional insights, such as purchase patterns by day of the week, seasonality, and consistency checks.
3. Data Storage and Management: (Optional) Store the cleaned and processed data in an SQL database to simulate a real-world data warehousing solution.
4. Data Aggregation and Analysis: Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, customer segmentation, and product popularity across various dimensions.
5. Data Visualization: Generate insightful visualizations to communicate trends and findings effectively.
6. ETL Automation and Monitoring: Set up automation to handle the ETL process on a scheduled basis and monitor the workflow to detect issues in real time.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

* Transaction ID: Unique identifier for each transaction
* Date: Transaction date
* Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer
* Gender: The gender of the customer
* Product Category: Category of the purchased product
* Quantity: Number of items purchased in the transaction
* Price per Unit: Price of each item
* Total Amount: Total amount spent in each transaction
## Project Structure
* data/: Directory for raw and cleaned datasets.
* notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks documenting each step of the ETL process, from data exploration to visualization.
* scripts/: Python scripts automating the ETL pipeline and data validation.
* visualizations/: Generated charts and graphs from the analysis.
* README.md: Project documentation and objectives (this file).
